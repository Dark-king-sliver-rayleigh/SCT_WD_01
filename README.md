#This project is a responsive landing page that was developed as part of my internship task with SkillCraft Technology. 
#The landing page features a unique, dynamic design that changes style and theme based on the userâ€™s scroll position, creating an engaging and immersive experience. 
#Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the project employs a responsive layout, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. 
#As users scroll, JavaScript triggers smooth, visually appealing animations, allowing for seamless transitions between themes. 
#This approach not only enhances visual appeal but also provides an intuitive, interactive experience for the user. 
#The project demonstrates my skills in responsive web design and interactive front-end development, showcasing the ability to combine functionality with a sleek, user-friendly interface.
